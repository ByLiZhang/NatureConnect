# Nature Connect

NatureConnect is a web application version of the classic Connect Four game!

## Motivation

This project was originally built during a 2-day hackathon. It grew out of our desire to expand our JavaScript skills while making a simple game with a Nature theme.

## Usage
Player(s) can choose the number of matches to play in a Best-of-N series.

To add more depth to the Connect Four game play, we programmed a simple AI that is enabled against a single player by default. Two-players mode can be selected by clicking the AI/Human  box for a dropdown menu. Prospective players only need to select their tokens, and then click on the start button to begin!
